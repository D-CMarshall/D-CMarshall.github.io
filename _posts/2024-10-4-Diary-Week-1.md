My first week as a PhD student was an interesting one; learning how to manage my time without strict boundaries in place has been a learning curve. My background as a mathematics teacher and foundation year lecturer has trained me to be somewhat rigid with my time, whether that be via explicit teaching timetables and 1:1 meetings or self-imposed ‘I need to get this task done to get it out of my mind’-type restrictions. However, as a PhD student, I need to retain information long-term. Therefore, I resorted to old behaviours and created a timetable, briefly describing my various commitments and allocating a sensible amount of time to study.


This is of course adaptable and subject to change, though an outline of a timetable forces me to focus on certain tasks as and when I need to. I would highly recommend that every student creates a timetable to support their studies. I have provided links to various time management resources that I like below. Feel free to check them out.:
