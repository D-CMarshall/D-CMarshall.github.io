## Teaching Experience

I have four years experience teaching A-Level and GCSE Mathematics. In that time, I have taught:
- Edexcel GCSE Mathematics (Higher and Foundation)
- Edexcel A-Level Further Mathematics
- OCR A-Level Mathematics
- OCR Level 2 Functional Skills

## A-Level and GCSE Mathematics Teaching Resources

I have taught a wide array of students and strived to support them with differentiated resources. 

Please see the resources I have uploaded to TES \\link[here]{https://www.tes.com/teaching-resources/shop/DannyCMarshall}.
